- 👀 I’m interested in IoT and Telemetry in SCADA applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 'proprietary' BASIC-dervied programming languages for use in datalogger applications, RTMC and HMI interfaces
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on unique subroutines and programs to control and interact with remote dataloggers, field equipment and solar systems
- 📫 How to reach me, here on GitHub!
